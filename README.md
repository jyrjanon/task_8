# Task 8 – VPN Setup, Testing & Privacy Analysis


## ✅ Objective
To understand how VPNs protect user privacy and ensure secure communication by setting up a free VPN, connecting to a server, and verifying IP + encryption.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- ProtonVPN Free (recommended)
- whatismyipaddress.com

## 🔧 Steps Performed
1. Signed up for ProtonVPN (free tier)
2. Downloaded and installed the VPN client
3. Connected to a VPN server (Free server)
4. Verified that my IP address and location changed
5. Tested encrypted browsing on multiple websites
6. Disconnected VPN and compared speeds + original IP
7. Researched VPN protocols, encryption, and privacy features

## 🔐 What is a VPN?
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates an encrypted tunnel between the user and the internet, hiding IP address, location, and traffic.

## 🔰 How a VPN Protects Privacy
- Hides your real IP address  
- Encrypts all data (AES-256)  
- Protects against network spying & tracking  
- Prevents ISP from monitoring browsing activity  

## 🔁 VPN vs Proxy
| VPN | Proxy |
|-----|-------|
| Encrypts traffic | No encryption |
| Hides IP fully | Changes IP only |
| System-wide protection | Browser-only in most cases |

## 🔒 What is Encryption in VPN?
VPNs use encryption algorithms (AES-256, ChaCha20) + protocols (OpenVPN, WireGuard) to secure the data tunnel.
